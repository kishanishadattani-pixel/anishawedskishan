As the celebration unfolds, the energy turns playful with music, games, and a pool party — a true dip into Italia — where the sun shines, food flows, and the celebrations continue effortlessly.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-14">Many routes allow for a short stopover, particularly when travelling via the Middle East. We flew with Qatar last September and had a free stopover and hotel stay included which turned it into a mini holiday! It was a lovely way to break up the journey.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-21">Late November in Hua Hin is warm and sunny, with temperatures typically around 27–30°C during the day and 22-25°C at night. The resort is by the beach meaning there is a nice evening breeze, so we&#x27;d recommend a light shawl or wrap for those who prefer to stay on the warmer side.</p>

          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p class="paragraph-21">For guests travelling from the UK, there are no mandatory vaccinations required to enter Thailand. We recommend ensuring that routine vaccinations are up to date, including MMR and diphtheria. If you have not already been vaccinated, Hepatitis A and Typhoid are commonly advised for travel to Thailand. For guests who plan to travel beyond the resort or visit more rural areas of Thailand, additional vaccines may be recommended, including Rabies, Dengue, Tetanus and Hepatitis A. We suggest speaking with your GP or a travel health clinic well in advance of your trip for guidance tailored to your travel plans.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-21">Thai Baht (THB) is the currency used locally. Although cards are widely accepted in the larger cities, we recommend keeping cash with you at al times.

          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p class="paragraph-21">Staying connected in Thailand is easy. SIM cards and eSIMs are available at Bangkok airport and throughout central Bangkok. We recommend using eSIM apps such as Airalo or Revolut before travelling. You can install these in the UK and they activate on arrival to Thailand. We found Revolut to be the most simple and affordable way to get online straight away. Complimentary Wi-Fi will also be available at the hotel.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-21">Thailand uses a mix of plug types, including two-pin round and flat pins. The hotel specifically uses two-pin type C round plugs. These are the same two-pin round adapters that are used for travelling in Europe and India. We recommend purchasing these in advance as there weren&#x27;t many available to purchase there.</p>
